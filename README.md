# Rules
- Each player has a deck (deck has no size limit)
- Each player starts by choosing 5 cards from their deck.
- A game board has 9 spaces. Each space can hold 1 card. (1 card will not be played by each player).
- Each card has a Top, Bottom, Left, and Right value.
  - The Top, Bottom, Left, and Right values are from 1 to 10
- When a card is played, it will be compared to adjacent cards and evaluate whether or not its values are greater than or less than the cards occupying those spaces.
  - If the values are greater than an adjacent card's, the adjacent card is captured.
  - Capturing a card earns a point?
